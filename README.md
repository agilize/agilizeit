# Agilize it!
Hey! This repository is purely intended to my buds at Agilize. My main achievement doing this script was just to automatize the whole environment installation proccess that we always pass when a system reinstalation is needed or something. 

# Updates
I'm going to update it as the same rythm we include new programs and features to use on development.

# Looking
