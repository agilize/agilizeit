# Agilize it!
Hey! This repository is purely intended to my buds at @Agilize. My main achievement doing this script was just to automatize the whole environment instalation proccess that we always pass when a system reinstalation is needed or something. 

# Updates
I'm going to update it as the same rythm we include new programs and features to use on development. To reach version 1.0, Agilize It! passed from 0.1 to 0.9, but on close source. Now that I consider this thing as "Stable", everyone can contribute to it, in order to make this script a future bootstrap to all of us. :smile:

# Anything else?
Uh, enjoy you guys!
